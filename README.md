# RideShare

Carpooling has emerged as a widely embraced mode of transportation for commuters heading to work or school in different cities. The growing demand for riders seeking seamless and hassle-free travel between cities lacks a dedicated platform. Presently, many of these commuters rely on Facebook Marketplace as their primary source for finding carpool rides. At Rideshare, we aim to address this gap in the market by introducing our dedicated carpooling application.
